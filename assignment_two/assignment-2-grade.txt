Assignment 2 assessment: Yoshida

Age Verification: Age should be determined by year of birth, not entry of how old you currently are. However, I like the case statement with the ranges.

Bill Calculator: Perfect

Guess Number: Good, maybe have the random only happen once per entry.

Nice organization of code, so tidy :-)
Great code, complete project!
